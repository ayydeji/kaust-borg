# Comparing Symbolic and Distributive Methods In Machine Learning.
## Overview.
This project was conducted in KAUST as part of the Bio-Otology Research group. In this repository you will find the files and results from normal distributive models e.g. TransE, TransR and ConvE in comparison with the results obtained from symbolic methods implemented using TILDE, GILPS and QuickFoil.
## System Requirements.
- Python3 
- [Pykeen]( https://github.com/SmartDataAnalytics/PyKEEN)
`
pip install pykeen
`
- TILDE ` git clone https://github.com/joschout/tilde.git`
- GILPS ` git clone https://github.com/bio-ontology-research-group/GILPS.git`
- QuickFoil ` git clone https://github.com/bio-ontology-research-group/quickfoil.git`
